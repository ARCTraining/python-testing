## Teaching Notes
*   Time estimates: When teaching this as part of an [advanced workshop](http://andreww.github.io/2016-01-06-bristol/), @andreww 
    managed the bulk of the material (sections 1-8 with some excercises skipped) in 2 hours. Feedback was that this was too rushed 
    (and I agree). The indicated 4 hours should be quite comfortable for the whole lesson.

*   A common problem with the [Continuous Integration](http://katyhuff.github.io/python-testing/08-ci.html) section seems to be
    that the format of the `.travis.yml` file is rather strict. A useful resource is the Travis WebLint found at
    https://lint.travis-ci.org/.
